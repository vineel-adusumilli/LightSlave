LightSlave is the Arduino complement to [lightwall](https://github.com/vineel-adusumilli/lightwall).

LightDuino connects to lightwall via a serial connection. lightwall then pushes RGB values to LightDuino which are output via DMX. The end result is an illuminated wall at [TinyFactory](http://tinyfactory.co/).
